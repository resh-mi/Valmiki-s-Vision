# Valmiki-s-Vision
Valmiki's Vision is a project that brings the epic characters of the Ramayana to life using deep learning techniques. Centered around a ResNet-18 model, this project accurately identifies Ramayana characters through image classification.

# Key Features
Efficient Model: Utilizes a ResNet-18 model pre-trained on ImageNet, ensuring reliable and effective character recognition.
Seamless Integration: Automatically detects classes based on folder structure, simplifying dataset setup and management.
Optimized Processing: Includes essential data transformations to prepare images for training, such as resizing and cropping.
Robust Performance: Implements cross-entropy loss and the Adam optimizer, complemented by an evaluation function to track accuracy.
Quick Start Guide
Requirements
Python 3.x
PyTorch
torchvision
(Optional) Google Colab for easy execution and data management
Steps to Run
Organize Your Dataset: Arrange character images in separate folders under a main directory.
Run the Notebook: Execute the Jupyter notebook to load the dataset, preprocess images, and train the model.
Evaluate the Results: Use the built-in evaluation function to check model performance on new data.
Applications
